# outlierRemover.py
This is a little code I made to get rid of outliers from any data set on a parabola. Hopefully I'll add a bit more in the future to make it more customizable.

# orderingDesmosList.py
This is a little code I wrote to just order a pair of Desmos lists, one for the x values and one for the y values, from the least x value to the highest x value and keep the correct y values.

# random2NumGen.py
Generates 2 random numbers on a certain scale then saves them to a list so it doesn't repeat them.
